## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: You MUST Run as Administrator

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**

- Press: **Win + X**
- Click: **Terminal (Admin)** or **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**
- Click: **Yes** when prompted

You should see:
```
PS C:\Users\Rey>  (or similar admin path)
```

### 2. **Run These Commands (Copy & Paste)**

```powershell
$env:HOME="$env:USERPROFILE"
cd C:\Users\Rey\Desktop\percolator-fork
cargo build-sbf
```

**‚è≥ Wait 3-5 minutes** for the build to complete.

You should see:
```
Finished `sbf-release` profile [optimized] target(s) in X.XXs
```

### 3. **Deploy Router Program**

```powershell
solana program deploy target/sbf-solana-solana/release/percolator_router.so
```

Look for output like:
```
Program deployed to: RoutR1VdCpHqj89WEMJhb6TkGT9cPfr1rVjhM3e2YQr
```

### 4. **Deploy Slab Program**

```powershell
solana program deploy target/sbf-solana-solana/release/percolator_slab.so
```

Look for output like:
```
Program deployed to: SLabZ6PsDLh2X6HzEoqxFDMqCVcJXDKCNEYuPzUvGPk
```

### 5. **Verify Both Programs**

```powershell
solana program show RoutR1VdCpHqj89WEMJhb6TkGT9cPfr1rVjhM3e2YQr
solana program show SLabZ6PsDLh2X6HzEoqxFDMqCVcJXDKCNEYuPzUvGPk
```

Both should show program details ‚úÖ

## üéØ If You Get Errors

### "A required privilege is not held by the client"
- **Solution**: You're NOT running as admin
- **Fix**: Close PowerShell, right-click it, select "Run as administrator"

### "cargo build-sbf not found"
- **Solution**: Solana platform tools not installed
- **Fix**: Run: `curl https://release.solana.com/v1.18.0/install | sh`

### "solana config get" shows wrong network
- **Solution**: Not on devnet
- **Fix**: Run: `solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com`
