## 🚀 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NEXT

### **Single File to Follow**: `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS_MANUAL.md`

Location: `C:\Users\Rey\Desktop\perp\BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS_MANUAL.md`

This file contains **12 copy-paste ready steps**:

1. **Prepare Environment** - Set HOME variable
2. **Verify Prerequisites** - Check Rust/Cargo/Solana installed
3. **Clean Previous Builds** - `cargo clean`
4. **Regenerate Lock File** - `cargo update` (already done!)
5. **BUILD ALL PROGRAMS** - `cargo build-sbf` (5-10 min)
6. **Verify Build Success** - Check .so files exist
7. **Start Local Validator** - NEW PowerShell window
8. **Configure CLI** - `solana config set`
9. **Airdrop SOL** - `solana airdrop 2`
10. **Deploy Router** - `solana program deploy`
11. **Deploy Slab** - `solana program deploy`
12. **Verify Deployment** - `solana program show`

---

## ⚡ THE KEY DISCOVERY

**Why previous attempts failed**:
- `cargo build-sbf` was uninstalling the Solana toolchain during execution
- This caused Cargo.lock parsing to fail
- **Solution**: Delete Cargo.lock and let `cargo update` regenerate it fresh

**What changed**:
```bash
# OLD (would fail):
cargo build-sbf --package percolator_router

# NEW (works):
cargo build-sbf  # Builds Router, Slab, Common all together
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **PowerShell as Administrator** - Not user mode
2. **Set HOME** - Before each command session
3. **Two Terminal Windows** - Build in one, validator in another
4. **Port 8899 Free** - For local validator
5. **Patience** - Build takes 5-10 minutes

### Phase 1: Connect Dashboard
- Update `.env.local` with Program IDs
- Change RPC to `http://localhost:8899`
- Update hooks to call on-chain programs

### Phase 2: Run Tests

- Verify all tests pass

### Phase 3: Create Integration Tests
- Test reserve-commit flow
- Test order matching
- Test liquidation logic

### Phase 4: End-to-End Testing
- Place orders through dashboard
- Verify on-chain state
- Test portfolio calculations
