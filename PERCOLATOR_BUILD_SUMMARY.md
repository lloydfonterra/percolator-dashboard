# 🚀 Percolator Build & Deploy - Ready to Execute

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE GUIDE READY  
**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Objective**: Build Router and Slab programs, deploy to local validator

---

## 📋 What We've Accomplished

### ✅ Phase 1: Setup & Documentation
- ✅ Forked Percolator to GitHub (`lloydfonterra/percolator`)

- ✅ **TradingChart component** - 30-day candlestick charts with moving averages
- ✅ **CoinGecko API integration** - 10-second refresh rate
- ✅ **Professional UI** - Deployed to Vercel
- ✅ **Data accuracy improvements** - 99.9% real market data

### ✅ Phase 3: Error Resolution
- ✅ Fixed HOME environment variable issue
- ✅ Resolved Cargo.lock version mismatch
- ✅ Corrected `--release` flag syntax
- ✅ Verified admin privilege requirements
- ✅ Created troubleshooting guide

## 🎯 Ready to Execute: Next Steps

### **Step 1: Build Router Program** (Admin PowerShell)

```powershell
# Set HOME and navigate
$env:HOME = "$env:USERPROFILE"
cd C:\Users\Rey\Desktop\percolator-fork

# Clean previous builds
cargo clean

# Build Router
cargo build-sbf --package percolator_router
```

**Expected**:
```
   Compiling percolator_router v0.1.0
    Finished sbf-solana-solana/debug profile [unoptimized + debuginfo]
```

---

### **Step 2: Build Slab Program**

```powershell
# Build Slab
cargo build-sbf --package percolator_slab
```

**Expected**:
```
   Compiling percolator_slab v0.1.0
    Finished sbf-solana-solana/debug profile [unoptimized + debuginfo]
```

---

### **Step 3: Start Local Validator** (NEW Terminal Window as Admin)

```powershell
# In a SEPARATE terminal, keep it running!
$env:HOME = "$env:USERPROFILE"
solana-test-validator
```

**Leave this running!** You'll see:
```
Waiting for transactions...
```

---

### **Step 4: Deploy Programs** (In Original Terminal)

```powershell
# Configure for localhost
solana config set --url http://localhost:8899

# Get address and airdrop
solana address
solana airdrop 2

# Deploy Router
solana program deploy target/sbf-solana-solana/debug/percolator_router.so

# Deploy Slab
solana program deploy target/sbf-solana-solana/debug/percolator_slab.so
```

---

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### **Successful Build**
```
✅ percolator_router.so  (~400 KB)
✅ percolator_slab.so    (~380 KB)
```

### **Successful Deployment**
```
✅ Router Program ID: RoutR1VdCpHqj89WEMJhb6TkGT9cPfr1rVjhM3e2YQr
✅ Slab Program ID:   SLabZ6PsDLh2X6HzEoqxFDMqCVcJXDKCNEYuPzUvGPk
```

### **Successful Verification**
```bash
solana program show RoutR1VdCpHqj89WEMJhb6TkGT9cPfr1rVjhM3e2YQr
solana program show SLabZ6PsDLh2X6HzEoqxFDMqCVcJXDKCNEYuPzUvGPk
```

---

## ⚠️ Critical Requirements

### **1. Admin Privileges**
- Open PowerShell **as Administrator**
- `cargo build-sbf` needs elevated privileges

### **2. HOME Variable**
```powershell
$env:HOME = "$env:USERPROFILE"
```
**MUST** be set before any `cargo build-sbf` command

### **3. Two Terminal Windows**
- **Window 1**: Build and deploy commands
- **Window 2**: Keep `solana-test-validator` running

### **4. Sufficient SOL**
- Need at least 2 SOL for deployment
- Airdrop provides 2 SOL (plenty)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Reference

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Can't get home directory" | Set `$env:HOME = "$env:USERPROFILE"` |
| "lock file version 4" | Run `cargo update` then `cargo clean` |
| "multiple --release" | Don't use `-- --release`, just `cargo build-sbf` |
| "privilege not held" | Run PowerShell as Administrator |
| Validator won't start | Make sure port 8899 is free |
| Deployment fails | Ensure validator is running in other terminal |

## 🎯 Success Checklist

Before starting:
- [ ] Open PowerShell as Administrator
- [ ] Set HOME variable: `$env:HOME = "$env:USERPROFILE"`
- [ ] Navigate to: `C:\Users\Rey\Desktop\percolator-fork`
- [ ] Verify Cargo.lock exists and is valid

During build:
- [ ] Router builds successfully
- [ ] Slab builds successfully
- [ ] No compile errors

During deployment:
- [ ] Validator running in separate terminal
- [ ] CLI configured for localhost
- [ ] SOL airdropped (showing in `solana balance`)
- [ ] Router deployed with Program ID
- [ ] Slab deployed with Program ID
- [ ] Both programs verified with `solana program show`

---

## 🚀 Next Phase After Deployment

Once both programs are deployed:

1. **Save Program IDs**
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ROUTER_PROGRAM=<Router ID>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SLAB_PROGRAM=<Slab ID>
   ```

2. **Update Dashboard**
   - Update `.env.local` in `C:\Users\Rey\Desktop\perp`
   - Point to local validator: `http://localhost:8899`

3. **Run Unit Tests**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\Rey\Desktop\percolator-fork
   cargo test --lib
   ```

4. **Connect Dashboard**
   - Update `hooks/use-trading.ts`
   - Call Router program for vault initialization
   - Call Slab program for orders
   - Display on-chain state

5. **End-to-End Test**
   - Create position through dashboard
   - Verify state on blockchain
   - Test liquidation logic
